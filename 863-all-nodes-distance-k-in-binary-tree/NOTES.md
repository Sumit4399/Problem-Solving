Self Notes:
🍋 Mark each node to its parent to traverse upwards
🍋 We will do a BFS traversal starting from the target node
🍋 As long as we have not seen our node previously, Traverse up, left, right until reached Kth distance
🍋 when reached Kth distance, break out of BFS loop and remaining node's values in our queue is our result
